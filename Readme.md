# Sled Entity

## A small structural layer on top of `sled`, `serde` and `bincode`

Sled Entity is a small structural layer on top of sled, using serde and bincode for serialization, written entirely in pure rust.

It serves as a convenient middle ground to store, retreive and update structs in an embedded database with a bare-minimum relationnal model.

## Getting Started

### Create a sled database

```rs
use sled_entity::Db;
```

```rs
let db = sled_entity::open("./")?;
```

:bulb: Since this is just a `sled` DB, this object can be copied and sent accross threads safely.

### Implement the `Entity` trait on your `struct`

Entities need to implement the `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits from `serde`, which are conveniently re-exported from `sled_entity`:

```rs
use sled_entity::{Serialize,Deserialize,Entity}

#[derive(Serialize,Deserialize)]
pub struct MyStruct {
    pub id : u32,
    pub prop1 : String,
    pub prop2 : u64,
}
```

Then you need to implement the `Entity` trait and implement three methods : `get_key`, `set_key` and `tree_name`, as well as define an associated type, `Key`

 - `Key` is the type of the identifier for each instance of your entity. It must implement the `AsByte` trait. 
 üòå‚òù It's already implemented for `String`, `u32`, `i32`, `u64`, `i64` and `Vec<u8>`, as well as for any 2-elements tuple of those types, so you should not need to implement it yourself.

 - The `key` represents the unique key that will be used to identify each instance of your struct in the database, to retreive and update them, it is of type `Key`
 - The `tree_name` is the name of the store. It should be unique for each Entity type.

```rs
impl Entity for MyStruct{
    type Key = u32;
    fn tree_name() -> &'static str {
        "my-struct"
    }
    fn get_key(&self) -> Self::Key {
        self.id
    }
    fn set_key(&mut self, key : Self::Key) {
        self.id = key;
    }
}
```

### Register your entity with the system

Register the entity once, when you launch your application.

```rs
let db = sled_entity::open("./")?;
```
```rs
MyStruct::register(db)?;
```

### Save an instance to the database

You can now save an instance of your struct `MyStruct` to the database :
```rs
let db = sled_entity::open("./")?;
```
```rs
let instance = MyStruct {
    id : 0,
    prop1 : String::from("Hello"),
    prop2 : 2335,
}
instance.save(&db)?;
```

:bulb: If `id` 0 already exists in the database, it will be overwritten!

### Retreive an instance from the database

```rs
let instance = MyStruct::get(0,&db)?;
```

### Retreive all instances

```rs
let instances = MyStruct::get_all(&db)?;

```

### Get All entities respecting a condition


```rs
let instances = MyStruct::get_with_filter(|m_struct| {mstruct.prop1.len > 20},&db)?;
```

### Delete an instance from the database

```rs
MyStruct::remove(0,&db)?;
```

## Defining Relations

`sled_entity` has three types of relations : 

 - `sibling` : An entity that has the same key in another tree (one to one relation)
 - `parent-child` : An entity which key is composed of its parent's key and a `u32` (as a two-element tuple) for quick searching one to many relations
 - `free-relation` you freely connect two instances of two separate Entities together. This can be used to achieve many to many relationships, but is less efficient than sibling and parent-child relationships in regard to querying the database.

### Sibling relationships

To create a sibling Entity, you need to link the Entity structs together by overriding the `get_sibling_trees()` method :

```rs
impl Entity for MyStruct1{
    /* ... */
    fn tree_name() -> &'static str {
        "my_struct_1"
    }
    fn get_sibling_trees() -> Vec<(&'static str,DeletionBehaviour)> {
        return vec![("my_struct_1",DeletionBehaviour::Cascade)]
    }
}

impl Entity for MyStruct2{
    /* ... */
    fn tree_name() -> &'static str {
        "my_struct_2"
    }
    fn get_sibling_trees() -> Vec<(&'static str,DeletionBehaviour)> {
        return vec![("my_struct_1",DeletionBehaviour::BreakLink)]
    }
}
```

:bulb: if sibling trees are defined, an entity instance might or might not have a sibling of the other Sibling type! Siblings are optionnal by default.

:bulb: DeletionBehaviour determines what happens to the sibbling when the current entity is removed :

 - `DeletionBehaviour::Cascade` also deletes sibling entity
 - `DeletionBehaviour::Error` causes an Error if a sibling still exists and does not delete the source element
 - `DeletionBehaviour::BreakLink` just removes the entity without removing its sibling.

In the above example, deleting a `MyStruct1` instance also deletes its sibling `MyStruct2` instance, but deleting the `MyStruct2` instance leaves its sibling `MyStruct1` instance intact.

:bulb: Sibling Entities must have the same `Key` type.

#### Creating a sibling entity

```rs
let m_struct_1 = MyStruct1 {
    /* ... */
};
let mut m_struct_2 = MyStruct2 {
    /* ... */
};
m_struct_1.save(&db)?;
m_struct_1.save_sibling(m_struct_2,&db)?;
```

:bulb: this will update `m_struct_2`'s key to `m_struct_1`'s key using the `set_key` method.

#### Retrieving a sibling entity

```rs
if let Some(sibling) = m_struct_1.get_sibling::<MyStruct2>(&db)? {
    /* ... */
}
```

### Parent-child relationship

For a parent-child relationship between entities to exist, the child entity must have a `Key` type being a tuple of :
 - The parent `Key` type
 - `u32`

Children entities will be auto-incremeted and easily retreived through their parent key.


```rs
impl Entity for Parent{
    type Key = String;
    /* ... */
    fn tree_name() -> &'static str {
        "parent"
    }
    fn get_child_trees() -> Vec<(&'static str)> {
        return vec![("child", DeletionBehaviour::Cascade)]
    }
}

impl Entity for Child{
    type Key = (String, u32);
    /* ... */
    fn tree_name() -> &'static str {
        "child"
    }
}
```

In the above example, deleting the parent entity will remove all child entities automatically (thanks to the `Cascade` deletion behaviour).
**For database integrity, it is strongly advised not to use `DeletionBehaviour::BreakLink` on parent/child relations,** and instead use either `Error` of `Cascade`

#### Adding a child entity

```rs
let parent = Parent {
    /* ... */
};

let mut child = Child {
    /* ... */
}

parent.save_child(child,&db)?;
```

:bulb: this will update `child`'s key to `parent`'s key and an auto-incremented index using the `set_key` method.

#### Getting Children

```rs
let children = parent.get_children::<Child>(&db)?;
```

### Free relations

Free relations follow the same pattern as other relation types, except they are freely created between any entities. This can be used to achieve many to many relationships.

:bulb: Creating a free relation will automatically create its opposite relation, making it two-way.

#### Linking two entities 

```rs
let e1 = Entity1 {
    /* ... */
};

let mut e2 = Entity2 {
    /* ... */
}

e1.create_relation(e2,DeletionBehaviour::Cascade, DeletionBehaviour::BreakLink,&db)?;
```

In the above example, deleting `e1` will automatically delete `e2`, but deleting `e2` will leave `e1` untouched.

`DeletionBehaviour::Error` is also an option.

#### Getting related entites from a given tree

```rs
let related_entities = e1.get_related::<Entity2>(db)?;
```
To get only the first related entity from the other tree, use 

```rs
let related_entity = e1.get_single_related::<Entity2>(db)?;
```

#### Breaking a relation link

If needed, you can remove an existing link between entities:

```rs
e1.remove_relation(other,db)?;
```
or
```rs
e1.remove_relation_with_key::<OtherEntity>(otherKey,db)?;
```

### Auto-incrementing entities

If your entity `Key` type is `u32`, you can auto-increment new entities using

```rs
use sled_entity::AutoIncrementEntity;
let mut new_entity = Entity {
    id : 0 // if you setup id with any key, saving will update it
    /* ... */
};
new_entity.save_next(db)?;
// new_entity's key is now the auto-incremente value
```

You entitie's key will be automatically updated with `set_key` to match the last found entry's ID, incremented by 1.

:bulb: Note that the `AutoIncrementEntity` trait needs to be in scope.
